# LC3-Projects
Welcome to my collection of LC-3 assembly projects! This repository contains various programs written in LC-3 assembly, demonstrating fundamental concepts of low-level programming, computer architecture, and system control.

Each project in this repository explores different aspects of LC-3 assembly programming, including:

Arithmetic Operations – Performing signed and unsigned integer addition with overflow detection.
Memory Manipulation – Using pointers, loading and storing values in memory.
Bitwise Operations – Masking, shifting, and logical operations for data extraction.
Control Flow – Implementing conditional branching and looping structures.
